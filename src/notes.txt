React => UI Library (only responsible for making front end)

Declarative
Compnent based
WOUA

component => UI + data + logic


=> class based
=> functional component

UI=> JSX
(syntactical sugar)
(javascript xml)

rules : 
0) It looks like html but not actually html.
1) jsx must have only one tag at root level (Fragments <></>)
2) use className instead of class
3) use htmlFor instead of for
4) always close a tag
5) to use js expression(not statements) => {}
6) conditional rendering (&& and ternary operator ?: )
7) list rendering (using map also provide a key ) (keyed framwork)




data =>
    external data (props)
        (props must be read only)
        user defined
        children & key
        propType

    internal data (state)
        this.state inside constructor


logic =>
    event binding



constructor => super()
            => set initialState
            => for methods binding
        
static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state) => return new state
    => if we want to put data from props to state, for that this is the right place


render =>
    => for UI part
    => never use side effect code

componenDidMount() => side effect code (network/http/api calls, dom manipulation, dom event binding, )
