component => UI + data + logic

UI=> JSX
(javascript xml)

rules : 
1) jsx must have only one tag at root level (Fragments <></>)
2) use className instead of class
3) use htmlFor instead of for
4) always close a tag
5) to use js expression(not statements) => {}
6) conditional rendering (&& and ternary operator ?: )
7) list rendering (using map also provide a key ) (keyed framwork)
